# arc-magic-variables
The `<arc-magic-variables>` element is an element that supports "magic variables" in ARC.
Magic variables are special strings that are passed to the any string field in the request
and it will be replaced with other string that is defined for this variable.

## Example
Let's say you want to generate a random number in the request. You can put a magic variable into
any request field that is containing string value:

```http://www.domain.com/?time=${now}```
can produce something like:
```http://www.domain.com/?time=12312312312```

## Build-in magic variables.
| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${random}` | Will generate random number in range from 0 to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER | 9007199254740991 |
| `${random:NUMBER}` | A variation of `${random}` where result will be remembered and can be used on other field. If the same `NUMBER` occurs again then previously generated value will be used. | 7199254740 |
| `${now}` | Inserts current epoch time | 12312312312 |

## Defined locally magic variables.
An app instance can create its own magic variables. There are two types of magic variables:
* global - Applied to every request
* scoped - Applied to a request enclosed in a project.

User-defined variables are kept in IndexedDB and can be retreived or changed on demand.

### Global variables
They are like build-in variables but the users can define their own wariables.
Variables this type will be applied to every outgoing request.

### Scoped variables.
Scoped variables are associated with a project and will be applied to those request that are added to the same project.

## Database structure
| Property | Type | Is key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | Number | Yes, key path | An autoincremental key for the rule |
| variable | String | Yes | A variable name. It must be consisted with [0-9A-Za-z${}_-] |
| value | String | No | Replacement value. Replacement value may include other magic variables |
| type | String | Yes | Either `global` or `scoped` (for now) |
| project | Number | Yes | Relevan if `type` is set to `scoped`. The rule will be applied to the requests that are associated with this project. If not set if will be omnited. |

## Usage
The element expose one field `value` that will be parsed during the work. It may be either String or Object.
While String is obvious, the Object will be treated differently. It will parse only a values of each key that is associated with the key and if it is a string.
This means that no deep objects will be taken into consideration.

Before start applying new magic variables the program should call `clear()` function to clear the groups defined by previous use.
It will keep this data so you can use the element many times on different strngs resulting with the same group values.

```
<arc-magic-variables
  id="mv"
  value="[[headersList]]"
  scope="[[projectId]]"
  on-parsed="_onParsed">
</arc-magic-variables>
// in code:

...
this.$.mv.clear();
this.set('headersList', headers);
this.$.mv.parse();
...
_onParsed = (e) => {
  var headers = e.detail.result;
};
...
```
The parse method returns a Promise which will be fulfilled when it finish parsing data:
```
...
this.set('headersList', headers);
this.$.mv.parse()
.then((result) => {
  // parsed data
});
...
```
