# `arc-magic-variables`
The `<arc-magic-variables>` element adds "magic variables" supports in the ARC.

Magic variables are special strings that are passed to any string property in the request
and it will be replaced with other string that is defined for this variable.

## Example
Let's say you want to generate a random number in the request. So the property value like:

```
http://www.domain.com/?time=${now}
```
can produce:
```
http://www.domain.com/?time=12312312312
```

## Build-in magic variables.
| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${random}` | Will generate random number in range from 0 to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER | 9007199254740991 |
| `${random:NUMBER}` | A variation of `${random}` where the result will be remembered and can be used in other property. If the same `NUMBER` occurs again then previously generated value will be used. | 7199254740 |
| `${now}` | Inserts current epoch time | 12312312312 |

## Magic variables scopes
There are two types of magic variables:

* **global** - Applied to every request,
* **scoped** - Applied to a request enclosed in a project.

### Global variables
Variables of this type will be applied to every outgoing request.

### Scoped variables.
Scoped variables are associated with a project and are applied to those request that are added to corresponding project.

## User magic variables
This element supports user defined variables. Variables defined by the user are kept in IndexedDB locally and retreived by the element on run time. Users can decide either the variable is global or scoped.

## Database structure
| Property | Type | Is key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | Number | Yes, key path | An autoincremental key for the rule |
| variable | String | Yes | A variable name. It must be consisted with [0-9A-Za-z${}_-] |
| value | String | No | Replacement value. Replacement value may include other magic variables |
| type | String | Yes | Either `global` or `scoped` (for now) |
| project | Number | Yes | Relevant if the `type` is set to `scoped`. The rule will be applied to the requests that are associated with this project. If not set if will be omnited. |

## Usage
The element's `value` property contains a value that will be parsed during the work. It may be either String or Object.
While String is obvious, the Object will be treated differently. It will parse only string values of each first level key.
This means that no deep objects will be taken into consideration.

Before start applying new magic variables the program should call `clear()` function to clear the groups defined by previous use.
The element will keep groups generated data so it can be uses many times on different strings resulting with the same group values.

```html
<arc-magic-variables
  id="mv"
  value="[[headersList]]"
  scope="[[projectId]]"
  on-parsed="_onParsed">
</arc-magic-variables>
```
JavaScript code:
```
...
this.$.mv.clear();
this.set('headersList', headers);
this.$.mv.parse();
...
_onParsed = (e) => {
  var headers = e.detail.result;
};
...
```
The parse method returns a Promise which will be fulfilled when it finish parsing data:
```
...
this.set('headersList', headers);
this.$.mv.parse()
.then((result) => {
  // parsed data
});
...
```
