<!--
An element that will display a value as a link.
Regular data binding in Polymer is using innerText setter to assign value.
Thus any HTML tag won't be recognized and displayed as text.
This element will find links in the header value and display it as a link if necessary.
Parent elements may catch click on link and handle it properly.
