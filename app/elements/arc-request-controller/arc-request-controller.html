A request kept in the local storage is not a type of Request object.
This is a simple mapping to current request form options.
Other methods may translate this objecy to the RequestObject depending on the action (eg. save action). But then it still will be copy og this object.
So the idea is that the editor is working on a different object than it may be used to store data. This will simplify data flow in the app.

Final local copy of the object stored as a `latestRequest` is:
```
{
  url: 'String', // a url of the request,
  method: 'String', //a HTTP method
  headers: 'String', // A HTTP message part with the string values.
  payload: 'Any', // a payload message,
  isSaved: 'Boolean', // (Optional) true if original request that created this object originated from saved request, may be not set.
  isDrive: 'Boolean', // (Optional) true if original request that created this object originated from google drive, may be not set.
  id: 'String|Number' // (Optional) type depends on isSaved and isDrive, the ID of the original object, may be not set.
}
```
