# Roadmap

This is an overview of the roadmap for the Advanced Rest Client for next few months - up to a year.

Note, that this document is fluid and the change depends on users feedback and the environment.

Most of the planned function are described on issue tracker. New function has additional [design doc](https://github.com/jarrodek/ChromeRestClient/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign-doc) label. You are welcome to shape the app with your own ideas and with discussing existing ideas with the author.


## RAML integration
This is a high priority task. Projects as they are right in the app will be removed. New kind of projects - based on the [RAML 1.0](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/) spec - will take their place.

As for now projects were a set of not related requests that the user would like to bound together. Google Analytics showed that projects usage is at 18%. It's a lot but the potential in using standardized notation is huge.

The launch bug is https://github.com/jarrodek/ChromeRestClient/issues/509
